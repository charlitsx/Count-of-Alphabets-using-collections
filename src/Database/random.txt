1.(40 points) In "The Adventure of the Dancing Men," Mr.Sherlock Holmes was asked by a Mr. Hilton Cubitt of RidingThorpe Manor, Norfolk, to deduce the meaning of his wife'sstrange behavior, which seemed to stem from several notes lefton the sundial in their garden. The notes contained drawingsof stick figures, little dancing men in a variety ofpositions.After accumulating a number of these notes, Holmes concluded that they were a substitution cipher of some sort. Since Holmes was "fairly familiar with all forms of secret writings, and [was himself] the author of a trifling monograph upon the subject," he had no difficulty in breaking the code.He cracked the code by using frequency analysis. (see http://www.dcode.fr/dancing- men-cipher) Holmes' solution used the frequencies with which the 26 letters of the English alphabet appear in normal prose. Write a Java program which will tally letter frequencies in any plain text file a user wants. Find and use an appropriate Collections data structure to store letters and the number of occurrences. Your program should prompt the user to enter a filename, open the file, scan the text character-by-character, and count the occurrences of each of the 26 letters. You should not distinguish between upper and lower case letters, and punctuation should be ignored. Your program should print out each letter and its relative frequency amongst the letters in the file. That is, if there are 300 letters (excluding puncuation and whitespace) in the file, and 24 of them are the letter “w”, then w’s relative frequency is 0.08. Of course, we will test your program on the original Conan Doyle story! 2. (30 points) Write a program that meets the following requirements: • Define a class named Point with two data fields x and y to represent a point’s x and y coordinates. Implement the Comparable interface for comparing the points on x- coordinates and on y-coordinates if x-coordinates are identical. ?• Define a class named CompareY that implements Comparator<Point>. ?• Implement the compare method to compare two points on their y-coordinates and on their x-coordinates (only if y- coordinates are identical.) ?• Randomly create 100 points, add them to an appropriate collections data structure and use an appropriate collections algorithm to display the points in increasing order of their x-coordinates and in increasing order of their y-coordinates, respectively. ?
3. (30 points) Using an appropriate data structure write a program that makes sure a JAVA program’s grouping symbols match correctly. These are symbols like parentheses( ), curly braces { }, Angle brackets < >, and Brackets [ ]. ?For example, your program should print an error message (about an incorrect match) if your java source file contains the following class definition: ?     class Wheel {•        public void inflate(int psi {•        System.out.println("Inflating to " + psi + "psi");• ?}} ?Use command like arguments to read the JAVA source-code file.• ?Submission ?Submit as per usual requirements (One project per question. Final zip file contains all 3 project folders). ?For every homework assignment, Blackboard will allow only one file to be submitted. Also, once you have submitted a file to Blackboard, you are not allowed to remove it and re-submit another file. Because of this, you should be absolutely sure that you are finished with the homework and that it is correct before you submit it.
